# ChienLab-RNASeq-Analysis-LRRC15

The human gene LRRC15 is involved in maintaining fibrotic stroma and is considered a chemotherapy target [Ray, et. al 2022](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/82/9/1675/694702/Exploiting-LRRC15-as-a-Novel-Therapeutic-Target-in). To understand the response of ovarian cancer
cell lines to CRISPR deletion of LRRC15, differential gene expression was measured in the knockout versus control (WT) cell lines.
